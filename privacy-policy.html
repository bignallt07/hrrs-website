            <h2 style="text-align: center;">HR Recruitment Solutions Ltd Company number 13078833</h2>
            <p>HR Recruitment Solutions Ltd understands that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your personal
            data is used. We respect and value the privacy of all of our customers and will only collect and use personal data in
            ways that are described here, and in a way that is consistent with our obligations and your rights under the law.</p>
            <h3>What Is Personal Data?</h3>
            <p>Personal data is defined by the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “the Data Protection
            Legislation”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in
            particular by reference to an identifier’.
            Personal data is, in simpler terms, is any information about you that enables you to be identified.</p>
            <h3>Why do we collect your personal data?</h3>
            <p>We are retained by organisations to identify and place individuals into new employment opportunities. We have identified
            you as an individual that could be of interest to our clients.</p>
            <p>We take your privacy very seriously and, in order for us to keep you informed about relevant opportunities, we request
            to hold your personal data. If you do not allow us to do this, we will be legally obliged to remove you from our
            database and can no longer put you forward for such opportunities.</p>
            <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
            <p>Typically, we collect your current and previous employers, and details of your work, skills and experiences, education
            and qualifications.</p>
            <p>We will then store pertinent details of our relationship which could include elements such as records of interviews,
            opportunities we have put you forward for, information you have provided to us such as a CV/resume and copies of
            correspondence.</p>
            <p>We may store further information where we have placed you or you are in employed by us which could include start and end
            dates, pay history, umbrella company details and bank details.</p>
            <p>It is unlikely we will require or process any data which would be categorised as Special under the relevant data
            protection legislation but should we need to do so we would contact you and get your explicit consent to do so.</p>
            <h3>What will we do with your data?</h3>
            <p>We will hold your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To be able to place you to the most suitable position according to your background and experience.</li>
                <li>We may use your personal information to contact you to discuss the opportunity.</li>
                <li>We may use your data for the fulfilment and ongoing management of a contract where we have placed or hired you.</li>
                <li>We may also use your data for the purpose of identification</li>
                <li>To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who will we share your data with?</h3>
            <p>We will only make your personal information visible to the organisations we are working with when you are put forward
            for an opportunity or where required for the fulfilment and ongoing management of a contract where we have placed or
            hired you.</p>
            <p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>if we use 3rd parties for running our business processes. An example of this might be that we have our emails or our
                database hosted in the cloud. Whilst these cloud providers would not typically have direct access to your information,
                storage is considered processing under the relevant data protection legislation. Similarly, as an example, if we have
                employed you directly we would need to send your data as required by law to local tax authorities;</li>
                <li>if we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or
                buyer of such business or assets;</li>
                <li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order
                to enforce or apply our terms of use which includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for
                the purposes of fraud protection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Using your information to keep in touch with you</h3>
            <p>In addition to our typical processing we may use the information we hold about you in order to contact you in the
            following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To advise you of changes to our terms</li>
                <li>To advise you of any security concerns</li>
                <li>Where permitted by law</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How long do we hold it for?</h3>
            <p>We will hold your data for no longer than 2 years before seeking confirmation that you are happy for us to continue to
            hold your data. If we have placed you either with one of our clients or you have been employed directly by us, we are
            required by law to hold your data for 2 years.</p>
            <h3>Secure collection and storing of your data</h3>
            <p>All information that you provide to us, or we collect about you is stored on our secure servers. We understand that this
            includes confidential information and we have put in place a range of suitable physical, electronic and managerial
            procedures to safeguard and secure your information.</p>
            <p>Our staff have the minimum required access to your data, and are trained to ensure that it is protected, and kept
            secure.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best
            to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us; any transmission is at
            your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
            prevent unauthorised access.</p>
            <p>We do not store your information for longer than is necessary to provide the service, and to ensure that we have
            appropriate auditable records for business purposes.</p>
            <h3>Automated Decision Making</h3>
            <p>During our processing of your information we may use functions that could be defined as automated decision making.
            Typically, this would be where you have submitted a CV/resume to us and we use an industry standard 3rd party product
            which uses complex proven semantic and natural language algorithms to “read” and extract data from the submitted
            document and create a profile for you in our database. This information could later be used to then match your profile
            against vacancy profiles also stored within our database. We have conducted a Data Protection Impact Assessment and
            matched profiles and vacancies are assessed by our staff before we contact you in regard to the position to ensure
            suitability. If you have any questions about this process or to request that we do not use this process during our
            relationship with you, please contact us.</p>
            <h3>Your rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request from us access to your own personal information. This is sometimes known as a 'subject
            access request'.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you have the right to request from us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>that any inaccurate information we hold about you is corrected</li>
                <li>that information about you is deleted in certain situations</li>
                <li>that we stop using your personal information for certain purposes</li>
                <li>that your member profile is provided to you in a portable format</li>
                <li>that decisions about you are not made by wholly automated means</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many of the rights listed above are limited to certain defined circumstances and we may not always be able to comply
            with your request. We will tell you if this is the case.</p>
            <p>You also have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for direct marketing. We will inform you if we
            intend to use your information for this purpose or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for this
            purpose. You can exercise your right to prevent us using your information in this way by contacting us.</p>
            <p>If you choose to make a request to us to exercise any of these rights, we will aim to respond to you as soon as we
            reasonably can but no later than one month. We will not charge a fee for dealing with any reasonable request.</p>
            <p>If you are unhappy with how we are using your personal information or if you wish to complain about how we have handled
            a request, then please contact <a href="info@hrrecruitmentsolutions.com">info@hrrecruitmentsolutions.com</a> and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
            <p>You also have the right to complain to your local Data Protection Authority and a full list can be found here</p>

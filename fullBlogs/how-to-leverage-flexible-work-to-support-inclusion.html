            <strong><p>Guest Blogger: Perrine Farque</p></strong>
            <p>Flexible work, or hybrid work, is a way of working that suits an employee's needs, for example having flexible start and
            finish times, or working from home. Flexible work is well known for increasing employee retention, boosting career
            aspirations and productivity, and decreasing absenteeism at work. However, in practice, many employees fear negative
            career repercussions. <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/04/how-managers-can-be-fair-about-flexibility-for-parents-and-non-parents-alike">Some research</a> revealed that the use of flexibility policies has been shown to result in wage
            penalties, lower performance evaluations, and fewer promotions. How should employers approach flexible work to support
            true inclusion in 2021? How can HR leaders, business leaders and professionals encourage all employees to work in ways
            that allow them to perform at their best without fear of repercussions? This article will share three proven strategies
            to fully leverage flexible work to support inclusion in 2021.</p>
            <h3>1. Invest in learning and development for managers</h3>
            <p>Employers should support their team leaders and managers in learning how to manage flexible work successfully.</p>
            <blockquote>Research reveals that <a href="https://goremotely.net/blog/leadership-statistics/">83% of employers state it’s crucial to develop leaders at all levels, however only 14% of CEOs
            have the leadership talent they need to grow their businesses.</a></blockquote>
            <p>The gap in leadership talent is a major obstacle in developing organisations, so investing in learning and development
            for managers in how to manage flexible work is a key strategy to foster a successful workplace culture. Many leaders are
            not clear about how to measure performance in hybrid-work. It’s essential to establish a trust-based relationship for
            flexible work to be successful. Ensure that leaders understand that visibility and presenteeism is not the key to
            performance. Advise team leaders to set expectations for their team regarding how they expect tasks to be done in
            flexible work. Train your leaders on how to foster good communication by having regular check-ins with their people.
            Educate your managers on finding a balance between allowing flexibility and facilitating collaboration in hybrid work.
            Hire a professional speaker or facilitator who is an expert in inclusive culture to lead your manager training if
            necessary.</p>
            <h3>2. Manage team expectations</h3>
            <blockquote>A Nielsen survey revealed that 47% of working mums think flexible working has affected their career progression; what’s
            more, 41% of working mums feel their flexible working is not viewed positively by their colleagues and 29% feel
            discriminated against because of working flexibly.</blockquote>
            <p>The fear that many teams feel in association with flexible working is common. Many teams do not adopt flexible working
            by fear of missing out on promotions, pay rises and career progression opportunities. Employers should review ways of
            working to optimise team collaboration and relationships in hybrid work and communicate these expectations with
            different teams. In particular, employers should pay attention to team skills and flexibility. Having teams made of
            “multi-skilled” employees means that flexible work can be achieved more easily. Employers should also consider sending
            employees surveys asking them to highlight other skills they have or are interested in developing. Business leaders
            should also pay attention to team relationships in flexible work. Hybrid work may contribute to a lack of interaction,
            which could lead to feelings of isolation. Inviting teams to connect using online tools such as Slack and having regular
            social team gathering will help foster connections in hybrid work. Employers should share positive success stories of
            flexible work to motivate all teams to adopt flexible work.</p>
            <h3>3. Address barriers for individuals</h3>
            <blockquote>According to Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/workplace-flexibility-survey.html?nc=1">Workplace Flexibility Survey</a>a>, which surveyed 1,000 U.S. professionals, 94% of employees indicate
            they would benefit from flexible work options, but 30% also reported that they fear potential consequences to their
            professional growth, if they tap into remote work, flexible hours and similar arrangements.</blockquote>
            <p>As an employer, it is important that you address any psychological barriers your employees may have about flexible work.
            Your organisation should ensure that employees understand they have flexible working opportunities and you fully support
            this. Ensure that you communicate with employees often about their option to adopt flexible working when necessary; you
            could for instance set up groups on communication channels sharing best practices for flexible work such as ideas for
            working parents. You should also proactively address any career progression concern by sharing success stories of
            flexible work and offering learning opportunities for remote workers. Share positive flexible working stories from
            across the organisation to inspire employees to embrace flexible work. It is really important that you help all your
            employees understand that they are in control of their schedule.</p>
            <p>Flexible work offers many great benefits for the organisation and for employees and is a more inclusive way of working.
            It boosts employee well-being, workers efficiency and business continuity, while also decreasing absenteeism and
            operating costs. At the same time, many employers, HR professionals and business leaders recognize that flexible work
            might create some trust issues and fear of repercussion among employees, as well as some discomfort about how to
            implement it successfully. Following a few, simple strategies can help leverage flexible work to truly support inclusion
            in 2021 and beyond. Ultimately, employees should feel empowered to control their schedule around their individual needs
            and organisations should proactively support a positive work environment that supports an inclusive, flexible way of
            working. If you need help to create a more inclusive workplace environment in hybrid work, <a href="https://www.perrinefarque.com/contact">contact me here.</a></p>
